# tb310xu-Android16
Newer Android For The Lenovo Tab M9 (LTE version, TB310XU)

# READ THIS BEFORE CONTINUING

I will need to build TWRP, so this would be delayed until i succeed

I hope I will get it working, as this means that full android is achievable

# Continuing...

This is WIP and still building, early test versions will be available soon but will be very unstable!

Over time, I will add stability and new features, including getting things such as Camera and LTE working

Unfortunately, the newest version of Android Lenovo released for this is Android 13

I might release both a GApps version and a Vanilla version
